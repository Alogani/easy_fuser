//! Types and structures for FUSE filesystem operations.
//!
//! This module provides various type definitions and structures that are used
//! throughout the `easy_fuser` crate to represent FUSE-related concepts and data.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! - [`arguments`]: Defines argument types and structures for FUSE operations.
//! - [`errors`]: Contains error types and handling for FUSE operations.
//! - [`file_descriptor`]: Provides types related to file descriptors.
//! - [`file_id_type`]: Defines traits for file identification.
//! - [`flags`]: Contains flag definitions for various FUSE operations.
//! - [`inode`]: Defines the `Inode` type for representing filesystem objects.
//!
//! # Re-exports
//!
//! This module re-exports key types from its submodules for easier access, as well as
//! some types from the `fuser` crate that are commonly used in FUSE operations.
