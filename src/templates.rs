//! # Template Implementations for easy_fuser
//!
//! This module provides a collection of template implementations and utility helpers
//! designed to simplify the creation of FUSE filesystems using the easy_fuser library.
//!
//! ## Key Features:
//!
//! - **Composable Templates**: All templates in this module are designed with composition
//!   in mind. They can be used individually or combined to create more complex filesystem
//!   behaviors.
//!
//! - **Customizable Behavior**: Each function within these templates can be overridden,
//!   allowing for fine-grained control and customization of filesystem operations.
//!
//! - **DefaultFuseHandler**: A comprehensive starting point for implementing FUSE
//!   filesystems. It provides a default behavior for all standard FUSE operations.
//!
//! ## Usage:
//!
//! Users typically leverage these templates as a foundation for their own filesystem
//! implementations. By extending or composing these templates, developers can rapidly
//! prototype and implement custom FUSE filesystems while maintaining the flexibility
//! to override specific behaviors as needed.
//!
//! ## Available Templates:
//!
//! - `DefaultFuseHandler`: A complete implementation of basic FUSE operations.
//! - `fd_handler_helper`: Utilities for handling file descriptors in FUSE operations.
//! - `mirror_fs`: Templates for creating mirror filesystems.
//!
//! For detailed information on each template, refer to their respective documentation.
